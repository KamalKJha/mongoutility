Here’s a weighted scoring model for evaluating the databases based on use case requirements and key features. The weights are assigned according to the importance of the criteria in typical database selection scenarios.

Criteria Weights
Criteria	Weight (%)	Description
Scalability	20%	Ability to scale vertically or horizontally based on workload.
Consistency	20%	Support for ACID compliance and strong transactional guarantees.
Query Complexity	15%	Ability to handle complex queries, joins, and relationships.
Performance	15%	Throughput and latency for transactional and analytical workloads.
Integration	10%	Compatibility with existing tools, ecosystems, and applications.
Flexibility	10%	Support for schema evolution or non-relational data models.
Cost	10%	Cost-effectiveness in terms of licensing, infrastructure, and operational expenses.
Weighted Scoring Matrix
Criteria	Weight (%)	Oracle	PostgreSQL	MySQL	CockroachDB	MongoDB	Neo4j
Scalability	20%	3.5	3.5	3.0	5.0	4.5	4.0
Consistency	20%	5.0	5.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	4.0
Query Complexity	15%	5.0	4.5	3.0	4.0	3.0	5.0
Performance	15%	5.0	4.5	4.0	4.5	4.5	4.5
Integration	10%	5.0	5.0	4.5	4.0	4.0	4.5
Flexibility	10%	3.0	4.5	3.5	4.5	5.0	4.0
Cost	10%	2.5	5.0	5.0	4.0	4.0	4.0
Calculations
To calculate the total weighted score, multiply the weight (%) by the database's rating for each criterion and sum the results.

Example Calculation Formula:
Weighted Score
=
∑
(Criteria Weight) × (Database Rating)
Weighted Score=∑(Criteria Weight) × (Database Rating)

Total Weighted Scores
Database	Weighted Score
Oracle	4.3
PostgreSQL	4.6
MySQL	3.9
CockroachDB	4.6
MongoDB	4.3
Neo4j	4.2
